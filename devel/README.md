Alex Context NLG Dataset -- Development Files
============================================

This directory contains all intermediary development files for the Alex Context NLG Dataset in
various stages. Please refer to the [main README](../README.md) for more information about the
development process.

Subdirectory contents
---------------------

In development order, the subdirectories contain the following:

* `src/` -- source user utterance transcriptions extracted from call records
* `reparse/` -- user utterance transcriptions parsed by Alex English handcrafted SLU
* `abstract/` -- abstracted (delexicalized) user utterances
* `tasks/` -- NLG tasks generated by our bigram policy
* `cf_results/` -- CrowdFlower job results, with post-processed files (containing evaluation of the
    CF results and post-editing)

Files marked `.new` contain only data collected from our calls, files marked `.old` contain data
from calls collected by Vejman (2015). Files marked `.all` contain data from both sources (this is
what was used for the final dataset).
